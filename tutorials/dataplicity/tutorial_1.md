# Dataplicity Tutorial 1: Getting Access, Online Interface, and Unix Tools

We use Dataplicity to remotely manage Raspberry Pi's and access to flight
hardware such as PyCubed. First, ask Langston, Moritz, or Flynn for access to
Dataplicity.

<https://www.dataplicity.com>

Head over to the `devices` page:

![Devices](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/stanford-ssi/sequoia-software/assets/dataplicity/devices.png?raw=true)

Select the `Sequoia` Raspberry Pi:

![PyCubed](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/stanford-ssi/sequoia-software/assets/dataplicity/pycubed_mnt.png?raw=true)

The PyCubed drive is mounted at `/media/PYCUBED`. In the web view here, there
are a number of software tools available to you, such as the ability to reboot,
in the right column. All of the unix tools installed on the Raspberry Pi are
somewhat accessble to you--for example, you can use the `nano` text editor to
edit files but you can't use the `scp` command to copy files from your computer
to the Raspberry Pi in this interface.

## Editing files on the PyCubed drive

Let's edit a file on the PyCubed drive with `nano`!

```bash
nano main.py
```

![Nano main](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/stanford-ssi/sequoia-software/assets/dataplicity/nano_main.png?raw=true)

`Enter` to edit the file. Once you make your edits, type `ctrl-o` to "write" the
file. Then, do `ctrl-x` to exit.

## Copying files to the PyCubed drive

Make a file and put some stuff in it.

![Temp test](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/stanford-ssi/sequoia-software/assets/dataplicity/tmp_test.png?raw=true)

This time, let's save the file with `ctrl-s` (same as `ctrl-o` but it does not
prompt for a file name). Then `ctrl-x` to exit.

![Nano save](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/stanford-ssi/sequoia-software/assets/dataplicity/nano_save.png?raw=true)

Make sure you saved the file with the `cat` command (`cat` is technically for
concatenating (combining) files, but works fine for printing them in the
terminal!)

Now, we will move the file to the PyCubed with the `cp` ("copy") command. Syntax
for this is

```bash
cp SOURCE DESTINATION
```

For you, this would be:

```bash
cp tmp/test /media/PYCUBED/
```

![Copied](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/stanford-ssi/sequoia-software/assets/dataplicity/copied.png?raw=true)

Print the file in your terminal with:

```bash
cat /media/PYCUBED/test
```

And then delete the file with:

```bash
rm /media/PYCUBED/test
```

Despite all of these cool things, _we don't recommend using the web interface_
because it crashes fairly often.
